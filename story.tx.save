Hello my name is Timmy, I am a 6'2 basketball player from Texas. Tonight
is my last game of high school basketball and I plan to play as well
as I can to hopefully get college offers. I have spent all of my life 
playing basketball in order for this moment. Right now its five hours until
my game and I am warming up in my backyard pysching myself up for the final
game of the season
