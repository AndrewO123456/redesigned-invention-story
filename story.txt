Hello my name is Timmy and I am a basketball player currently striving
to attend UW-Madison and then move on to the NBA. Today is the last game
of my season and also the state final. Its five hours until the game and
I practicing in my favorite spot ever, my backyard. Butterflies filled
my stomach as I shoot in preparation. 

I lined up at the imaginary 3 point line in my backyard and eyed the basket,
calculating the same shot I've taken hundreds of times. Breathe in, breath out.
Clunk. My first shot bounced off the rim, flying right back at me. As did the second.
Frustrated, I returned to the line and tried to focus.

But, the ball showed no sign of going into the net. I went back to the line and tried one last time. I still couldn't make the shot. I was extremely worried I had lost my touch and wouldn't make it into the college of my dreams. I went inside and found my Dad, the basketball coach. I told him I couldn't make a three pointer and I started crying, and he came over and gave me a hug and said "Son, you're going to play tonight and you're going to set a record number of points tonight for the state final and I stand behind that!". That really helped me feel better. 5 hours later...
