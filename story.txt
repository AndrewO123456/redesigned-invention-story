Hello my name is Timmy and I am a basketball player currently striving
to attend UW-Madison and then move on to the NBA. Today is the last game
of my season and also the state final. Its five hours until the game and
I practicing in my favorite spot ever, my backyard. Butterflies filled
my stomach as I shoot in preparation.
