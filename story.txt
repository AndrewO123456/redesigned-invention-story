Hello my name is Timmy and I am a basketball player currently striving
to attend UW-Madison and then move on to the NBA. Today is the last game
of my season and also the state final. Its five hours until the game and
I practicing in my favorite spot ever, my backyard. Butterflies filled
my stomach as I shoot in preparation. 

I lined up at the imaginary 3 point line in my backyard and eyed the basket,
calculating the same shot I've taken hundreds of times. Breathe in, breath out.
Clunk. My first shot bounced off the rim, flying right back at me. As did the second.
Frustrated, I returned to the line and tried to focus.

But, the ball showed no sign of going into the net.
